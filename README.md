# p-Adic statistical field theory and convolutional deep Boltzmann machines

Understanding how deep learning architectures work is a central scientific problem. Recently,
a correspondence between neural networks (NNs) and Euclidean quantum field theories
has been proposed. This work investigates this correspondence in the framework of
p-adic statistical field theories (SFTs) and neural networks. In this case, the fields are realvalued
functions defined on an infinite regular rooted tree with valence p, a fixed prime
number. This infinite tree provides the topology for a continuous deep Boltzmann machine
(DBM), which is identified with a statistical field theory on this infinite tree. In the p-adic
framework, there is a natural method to discretize SFTs. Each discrete SFT corresponds to
a Boltzmann machine with a tree-like topology. This method allows us to recover the standard
DBMs and gives new convolutional DBMs. The new networks use O(N) parameters
while the classical ones use O(N2) parameters.
